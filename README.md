#Ashley Super Jumper - Multiplayer

Remake of the [Super Jumper](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-demo-superjumper) libgdx demo using the [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) entity framework. It is licensed under the [Apache license](https://github.com/SimonPae/ashley-superjumper-multiplayer/blob/master/LICENSE). The [integration of the Ashley framework](https://github.com/saltares/ashley-superjumper) was done by [saltares](https://github.com/saltares).

This simple game might help you understand how entity systems in general and Ashley in particular work.
